                        In order to learn math or physics, you have to put in the practice time. There is only so much time in the day, though, and this class is one of many things you&#39;re doing. I help students learn and apply their course material so their studying is productive and they are prepared for test day.

                        I have been a student, I earned my bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees in math and my bachelor&#39;s in physics, I taught math for several years as a graduate TA at Texas A&amp;M, and I have tutored privately since 2011.

                    <p>

                        Don&#39;t wait! Your course material builds on itself so the sooner we begin, the better you will understand your entire course. Through regular tutoring sessions I&#39;ll help you build a proper foundation of knowledge, use concepts to solve problems, and quickly recognize which strategy will solve a problem. Homework and quizzes will be opportunities to secure a portion of your grade and we will ensure that you&#39;re ready to prove your understanding on test day.

                    <p>

                        If you have specific questions, great! If you need help but aren&#39;t sure of exactly what to ask, that works too!

                        Maybe you&#39;ve done your studying and want a review &frasl; Q&amp;A session. Let&#39;s do it!<br/>
                        To prove your understanding on test day, you must be able to read a problem and immediately begin writing the solution. This requires knowing all terms, theorems, and formulas &frasl; algorithms; quickly recognizing which ones will solve a problem; and applying them quickly and correctly.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Take advantage of the reviews your professor and TA provide and then work with me if you need more help.  Neither they nor I can develop your understanding for you; you&#39;re going to have to put in the practice time.  If you need explanation or help with problem-solving strategies, though, I&#39;d like to work with you. There is only so much time in the day; I&#39;ll set you on the right track so your study time is productive.

                    </p>

                        I can help. Like academic duct tape, this is a stopgap measure and not a means of preparing for subsequent courses or careers. However, I will review the most important information with you, see where you need to improve in practice problems, and clarify as time allows.

                        I have been tutoring math and physics full-time since 2011. I've helped many students improve their grades, pass classes they were failing, or even get A&#39;s in courses they had previously dropped.

                        I taught math for several years as a graduate TA at Texas A&amp;M University. My classes consistently scored in the top percentiles on common exams, compared to 50 &ndash; 70 other sections each semester. I work hard to make concepts clear to each student and to establish understanding of the effort required for each student to achieve his or her goals.

I have learned, as a student and as a teacher, what is needed to understand the material in a given course.
