                        In order to learn math or physics, you have to put in the practice time. There is only so much time in the day, though, and this class is one of many things you&#39;re doing. I help students learn and apply their course material so their studying is productive and they are prepared for test day.

                    </p>

                    <h2>Get the benefit of experience</h2>

                    <p>

                        If you have specific questions, great &mdash; let's start there. Often, however, students don&#39;t know what they don&#39;t know. Working with an experienced teacher can really be a time-saver. I&#39;ve worked with a number of students who wanted help with calculus but struggled with algebra, for example. Algebra needs to be a reliable tool when you're trying to do calculus so we began by sharpening that tool. Once the algebra was in place the calculus became understandable; without the algebra the calculus was not going to happen.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On the other hand, course material has inherent difficulty. What does a given mathematical notation really mean? In what situations do you use combinations vs. permutations in counting, such as in a probability and statistics class? There is no rote procedure at all for something like estabilishing a limit via the epsilon-delta definition in calculus or like most things in an upper-level class, such as real analysis or abstract algebra.
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        I have been a student, I earned my bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees in math and my bachelor&#39;s in physics, I taught math for several years as a graduate TA at Texas A&amp;M and LSU, and I have tutored students since 2011. I know the material and I take pride in teaching it well.

                    </p>



                    <h2>What do you want to do?</h2>

                    <h3>Get help to excel in your course?</h3>

                    <p>

                        Don&#39;t wait! Your course material builds on itself so the sooner we begin, the better you will understand your entire course. Through regular tutoring sessions I&#39;ll help you build a proper foundation of knowledge, use concepts to solve problems, and quickly recognize which strategy will solve a problem. Homework and quizzes will be opportunities to secure a portion of your grade and we will ensure that you&#39;re ready to prove your understanding on test day.

                    </p>

                    <h3>Review for your test?</h3>

                    <p>

                        Maybe you&#39;ve done your studying and want a review &frasl; Q&amp;A session. Let&#39;s do it!<br/>
                        To prove your understanding on test day, you must be able to read a problem and immediately begin writing the solution. This requires knowing all terms, theorems, and formulas &frasl; algorithms; quickly recognizing which ones will solve a problem; and applying them quickly and correctly.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Take advantage of the reviews your professor and TA provide and then work with me if you need more help.  Neither they nor I can develop your understanding for you; you&#39;re going to have to put in the practice time.  If you need explanation or help with problem-solving strategies, though, I&#39;d like to work with you. There is only so much time in the day; I&#39;ll set you on the right track so your study time is productive.

                        I have been tutoring math, physics, and statistics since 2011. I&#39;ve helped many students improve their grades, pass classes they were failing, pass classes to graduate, or even get A&#39;s in courses they had previously dropped.

In College Station, TX, from 2011 to 2013, I tutored students from Texas A&amp;M University and Blinn College. In Midland, TX, in 2013, I tutored students from the University of Texas of the Permian Basin, Midland College, various high schools, and I worked with one elementary-school student in life science.

I work hard to make concepts clear to each student and to establish understanding of the effort required for each student to achieve his or her goals.

I have learned, as a student and as a teacher, what is needed to understand the material in a given course.

                            I may be able to help you with a course I don&#39;t normally tutor. I have tutored a student in graduate geophysics, helped a chemistry student become proficient with unit conversions, and worked with one elementary-school student in life science.<br/>

                            I charge $30/hour for one-on-one tutoring. I like to keep things simple &mdash; no packages, no fees; just a flat rate.

                        <p>

                            I work with small groups as well. <span id=RateScheduleLink rel="#ScheduleOverlay">Click here</span> to set up a session. When I help students and they also help each other, it tends to go really well &mdash; one student explaining something (correctly, lol) to another seems to greatly benefit both. When I end up helping multiple people independently, though, it doesn't seem like anyone gets as much out of it as they would have with individual sessions.
